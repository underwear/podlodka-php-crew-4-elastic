You can easily walk in the campus and admire the magnificent buildings, including library. We visited it in the summer, during the holiday break, and it  was very quiet, really great to have a walk there. "

The buildings are beautiful, old and reminiscent of English architecture, but not a-lot was happening, good experience but you could do this in an hour. "

Apparently non-university guides are not welcome on this campus, and we were told that if we were accosted by any security personnel we would have to leave straight away. This did not happen, so we got a lot of historical information from our guide and a wander between the various interesting buildings on campus. Worth some time if you can manage it."

This iconic university campus is worth a visit, but do your homework. Just strolling through won't do as the campus proper is so big, encompassing blocks and blocks. We were there for the history and the architecture. As visitors, we were not allowed to enter Memorial Hall so we missed seeing an awesome historic building. Strolling through Harvard Yard, we enjoyed the crowds taking photos with the John Harvard statue (by the esteemed sculptor Daniel Chester French). We checked out Sever Hall by Henry Hobson Richardson, a mainstay in Boston! Also the 1813 University Hall by Charles Bulfinch. Again, as a visitor, we couldn't go inside Widener Library to explore Mr Widener's personal library. We moved on to the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, the only Le Corbusier building in this country. We visited the Harvard Art Museums, spending a couple hours enjoying their art collections. The campus is home to two buildings by Minoru Yamasaki (based in our home city of Detroit) so we checked his work here. Then got in the car to see two buildings by Moshe Safdie: Rosovsky Hall and the Class of 59 Chapel; both are buildings designed for contemplation and spiritualness. Totally enjoyed our four hours exploring the Harvard campus!!"

We also chose to do a student led tour which we highly recommend.  It is definitely worth just wandering around, at the very least just to get a feel.  The campus itself isn’t very large and doesn’t have many dining or resting spots within (there are plenty surrounding the campus).  It is also worth it to go to the library and just wander around."

But I could have been on any campus in N. America it felt. That said, we did a simple loop of 'Harvard Yard', gawked at a few buildings, spotted the erroneously credited John Harvard statue, then headed back to warmer climes.
If you're an academic and/or historian, maybe this would tickle your fancy more than mine. 
Was it pretty? Sure. Did it stoke images of ""the smartest students on the continent"" within me? Nope."

Our tour guide Truong was really informative and engaging, eager to answer all questions and tell us all about his experience at Harvard. It was a shame we weren't able to go into buildings but otherwise the campus is stunning.

This made the visit not worth it as I could not properly show the campus to my children, with whom I was visiting.  Every other public venue in the Boston area happens to be open, including museums, stores and restaurants, but not Harvard.  This stark contrast underscores the stupidity of this policy as Harvard remains virtually the sole outlier in continuing the repugnant lockdown and creating an unwelcoming atmosphere for visitors."

Even if you are not a student, I highly recommend taking a day to visit the campus and seeing everything that Harvard has to offer.

It was a snow & rainy day of February month and was very cold making visitors hard to go around.

We walked around the campus and stopped at points along the way, finding out facts and information about the university that otherwise we wouldn't have found out. The visit was around two hours long, and there's no access to the inside of the university which was a shame. However, it was refreshing to see students who are so enthusiastic about their university, and proud enough to openly promote it to strangers. They really are a credit to their university. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Cambridge. Just don't make my mistake- I booked via Expedia, and was charged more than DOUBLE than I would've been had I paid on the day. Silly me falling for the ""these tickets are selling out"" scam and parting with double the money I should've."

Some of the stops were to see and learn about the history of The Widener Library, John Harvard Statue, Harvard Hall, The Dorms. In between the time was filled with anecdotes on life at Harvard. The tour ends with a visit to the gift shop which is also staffed by current students.  Well worth the visit."

She toured us around the various University yards and regaled us with tales about the founding of the University and the origins of the student halls and historical buildings we passed. She encouraged questions about her own experience and displayed an energy and enthusiasm which made time. I was particularly impressed to learn about the foresight of the colonists in founding the educational establishment way back in 1636. "

If you are coming organize a walking tour to get the most from the experience. Local students do a great one hour tour which is more insightful than other stuffy tour companies. 

The number of libraries in the area (77) will give you some idea of the scale of the place but you can’t get into them which was a major disappointment for us as s sit down with a book of newspaper would have been great. I totally get that students are trying to study but limited access would have been nice. 

The area around the university is like a new town so pretty soulless in my opinion. Spend the time in the university grounds or if the weather is good walk along the Charles river.

Reverend John Harvard, who bequeathed his entire library and half of his estate, is the University's namesake. Just 16 years following the landing of the Pilgrims, the original focus of Harvard University was to educate Christian clergy with its motto ""Truth for Christ and the Church"". Presidents, billionaires and Rhodes Scholars are only some of the illustrious graduates. The historic tree covered grounds with brick architecture are worthy of tour. The Gothic-Revival Memorial Hall/Lowell Complex was constructed in the 1870's to honor those men who served in the Civil War. Do enter this majestic building and view the colorful and stunning stained-glass windows, by both prominent artisans: Tiffany and LaFarge. Outside of University Hall in the Old Yard, take note of the bronze seated statue of John Harvard, and rub his golden left foot for good luck. Stroll past the 1916 Widener Library, the largest of Harvard's dozens of libraries, and don't miss the Memorial Church with its lovely light interior. We took the MBTA Red Line which delivered us to the Harvard Square Station. Easy, quick, convenient and inexpensive, this is a great means of travel. Up at street level when you depart the station, is a visitor kiosk for guidance. We walked the campus on a rainy day which I would not recommend, but it is doable. We had no other option.  A very enjoyable experience.

1. Tour does not take you anywhere inside the class rooms or dining halls or dorm room etc - it is all in the garden - from that perspective it was a shame to pay 15 USD.
2. Student led tour guides need to have a really loud voice else you really cannot hear what the person is saying - as the tour is completely outside and lot of noise from street traffic or construction

The ubiquitous red-brown brick buildings added to the serious and sombre ambiance – Harvard crimson is the official colour. One abiding memory is a throng of Japanese tourists walking around with selfie sticks snapping photos of themselves. Nevertheless, this is America's oldest university, and one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, with a long line of notable alumni, as noted by other reviewers. This is evidenced by the number of writers, thinkers, and Nobel laurates to have studied here, reflected in the subtle academic vibe exhibited by the students and staff, passing through the central courtyard where commencement is held. 

This area is surrounded by a number of famous and historic buildings - the Widener Library, Harvard Memorial Church and both the white granite University Hall and Sever Hall. The landmark John Harvard statue, sitting on a 6 foot granite plinth, is located outside University Hall facing both Harvard and Massachusetts Halls, and the Johnston Gate. Audio files of historical information on each of the buildings in Harvard Yard can be downloaded. It is good that visitors are welcome to roam freely around the campus of this famous university and see how it feels to be on this campus.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is housed in the University Museum Building, and the affiliated Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is located at Divinity Avenue on the campus. This is a very active university, so, of necessity, there is limited access during academic sessions. We didn’t go on any of the guided tours but did avail of the tour pamphlets at the tour office.

There’s a hodgepodge of architectural styles that you might expect in a place that has grown over the centuries but I’ve seen other historic colleges do a much better job of preserving the period and flavor of the founding times and original structures. This creates a more cohesive environment that I prefer.

Also given some of the World greatest leaders & entrepreneurs have attended this great seat of learnig.
This is not any dig about anything about America or any other issue ok.
This was our 10th time to America because we think its a great coutry to visit. However.
i would have imagined the actual buildings & campus itself would have lent to being visuallly old & inviting eg some of the visually wonderful university's in Oxford & Cambridge in the UK.
Sadly no, they all look almost modern to the point you might of been walking round a new(ish) University any were in the modern world.
Our guide ""Trent"" was excellent, informative & worth the money at $12 pp the guided tour lasted 75 minutes.
Or maybe i got hold of the wrong end of the stick? or i have been spoiled in the many other wonderful buildings i have seen.

Anyone I spoke to there was very helpful.  I love walking the grounds, seeing the beautiful library, and wishing maybe someday I could attend to finish out my degree. I also spoke to a recent Harvard student on the airplane and he confirmed for me all the things that Harvard represents. The vast different cultures of people that attend there is just first class.

It's Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the oldest and richest and most prestigious university in the United States. Established in 1636 and located about 3 miles northwest of Boston, it is a private Ivy League research university whose history, influence and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities. Its $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution. Its library, the world's largest academic and private library system, comprises 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Its alumni include eight U.S. Presidents, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars and 130 Nobel Laureates. Impressed? My wife and I were visiting Boston for the first time and a trip to Harvard was a no-brainer. I wanted to see Harvard Stadium, home of the Harvard-Yale football game that dates to 1875. And I wanted to see Harvard Yard, the oldest part of the Harvard campus, its historic center and its crossroads. Bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge Street, Broadway and Quincy Street, the grassy area of 22.4 acres enclosed by fence with 27 gates contains most of the freshman dormitories, the school's most important libraries, Memorial Church, several classroom and departmental buildings and the offices of the Dean of Harvard College and President of Harvard College. So how do you see it all. You can't. For example, there are 20 museums of culture, science and digital collections on campus, including Harvard Art Museum, Arnold Arboretum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard Museum of Natural History and Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. The business school and athletic facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston. We started at the Welcome to Harvard Information Center at the Smith Campus Center, 30 Dunster Street, in Cambridge. Established in 1962, its mission is to serve as the ""front door"" to Harvard by providing historic and general information about the  campus. We arranged for a self-guided walking and driving tour of Harvard Yard and Harvard Stadium. But visitors can choose a student-led public walking tour or group tour for 15 or more people or private tour or audio tour or mobile tour, whatever suits your time and fancy. Harvard was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and is listed as a U.S. Historic District."

The university campus is not as big as you would think. There is a sprawling park that you enter first which has different buildings including a library (which visitors can't enter) and a church. What was striking though was how the students and teachers were interacting in the park and not in formal classrooms. The actual university building is a little distance away. The building, however, lacked the character that you would associate with the image of Harvard in your mind."

It was his enthusiasm his heart poured out from every pore and his touch of humour interspersed between his accounts and anecdotes related to the university and the USA is highly appreciable. His pleasant accent, wit and spontaneity, not to speak of his obviously ivy league-ish intellectual caliber and on the top of it the way he made his listeners shed their inhibitions to carry them along with him all through with great aplomb has floored me. Mathew, you have a great future as a good human being, as you are now, and also to become a successful academicians/ or whatever you wanted to be in life besides, of course, a good communicator.

We made a special visit to come see the hallowed ground of Harvard.  As an educational institution, this is five stars.  There is not question about it, it's why we wanted to visit anyway.

The expectation against the actual campus is night and day.  First the amount of homeless around the exterior of the campus is surprising.  We were accosted for money on several occasions.  We watch two homeless yell at each other.  Homeless is not something you expect to say in the same sentence as Harvard.

Next, the campus is not that pretty.  It's a nice campus, but there is nothing special that catches your eye or lifts it up as beautiful.  Sidewalks go everywhere and cheap rope is used to keep people off the grass.

Last, nothing is available to see.  The key buildings you would love to see are not open without a tour.  Having kids in college, I appreciate this, but it's tough as a tourist.  Also, with all the homeless around the parameter of the campus, they can't let people in freely.

I was very disappointed with this campus.  I have visited so many campuses around the country.  The look, not the education, ranks in the lower half."
"2017-08-08T16:49:52-04:00","Desktop","5","review","1","Great experience and tour!","I went to Harvard with my family in July, seeing as it's such a great destination, and we were staying in the town Harvard, Massachusetts. Parking was relatively easy and close to find, which was a plus.

We did a Harvard walking tour, one that I couldn't find the place to review but was led by people in straw hats and t-shirts saying Hahvard. We had trouble finding the tour, but the Harvard faculty we asked were helpful. Our tour guide, Chase, was phenomenal, and made even my 14 year old brother, who was less than excited, enjoy the tour.

The campus is beautiful, and there were plenty of places to sit and relax along the way. There's a great gift shop with amazing sweatshirts (it's one of my favorite clothing purchases to date) and lots of places to eat around there.

While you really only need to see the campus once, it's a great trip regardless, especially for tourists wishing to see as much as the east coast as they can."
"2017-08-08T10:06:58-04:00","Mobile","5","review","3","This Is Not The Campus You're Looking For","This will be a rewarding visit, but don't look for a bucolic campus.
Harvard Yard is green, pleasant but more notable for its history and architecture. H.H. Richardson's Sever Hall and the Moot Court at Harvard Law school are worth your attention as are the many Harvard Museums. The Peabody Museum, famous for its glass flower collection, has an eye popping paleontology section which hosts a full size  Kronosaur skeleton-- a cousin to the Plesiosaur. Harvard's Fogg Art Museum now combines the collection of Harvard's other art museums which were previously dispersed around campus. The collection is fine and diverse. Across the street is the Carpenter Center which is housed in the only Le Corbusier building in the U. S.
Lesser known is the scientific instrument collection at the science center. Beautiful old brass and wood instruments give you a hands-on sense of the experience of researchers from centuries past. 
There is much more of course so a little home work before visiting will enrich your visit. You might get lost but don't be afraid to stop and ask directions. People are generally friendly interested in visitors.

Other tours that are out and making money will trick you into their own tour. 
We wanted to do the Historical Tour and then the Student Walking Tour that is detailed on the Harvard website. We searched for a long time for Smith Campus Center, Harvard Information Center, not realizing it was under construction. Per the website there is no charge for this tour. 
A waitress at our restaurant directed us to a tiny round building in a loop. A guy outside in a Harvard shirt with ""Tours"" sign directed us inside when I asked him about the Smith Center. Inside, two guys rang up $24.00 and acted like they didn't understand me and insisted that this was the historical tour. The guy outside said that this was the tour. We went on this stupid thing but I noticed that we only stayed in the public commons areas and then he lead us to a tiny shirt shop. 
Later on I found online the address for the Smith/Info Center and it was not the address of the above building. And with limited vacation funds, I wish to have that $24 bucks back. 
Advice: Know the exact address of where you need to go. Call ahead and clarify if there are charges. Search for a Harvard walking app or book and do your own tour as it is not a huge campus."

That said, my dad went here, and graduated from Harvard and Harvard Law, so I should be giving it 5 stars, but, sorry pops. I live close to Yale, where the scale is smaller, and the old buildings are more diverse. Here, the first impression is HUGE and BRICK. It's fun to wander around and look, but it seems impersonal, and many of the buildings are off-limits, so you're stuck just looking up all the time. At brick. You have to see it if you're in the area and haven't seen it, but it's a walk-though for stretching your legs more than anything else."

Take a walk through the yard, where all Harvard Freshman spend a year before being sorted into a house for the remaining three years, unless they join a social club or elect to live off campus. While in the yard, peek into memorial chapel - one of the few buildings open to the public.

Next, visit the Harvard Art Museum. The collections in this new museum are world class.

You also should check out the glass flowers at the Museum of Natural History - they are legendary. 

Make sure to take a quick walk through the Radcliffe Yard, which is across the Cambridge Common. It contains some of Harvard's oldest buildings.

The ART American Repatory Theater may have a show playing. Check ahead and build you visit around one. Many have gone to Broadway after being shaken down in this famed theater. 

Down the street form the ART is the famed home of poet Longfellow. If you like to walk. Continue down Brattle street away from the square. The homes are the finest in Cambridge. Also, the Mt. Auburn cemetery is also a favorite. 

Hungry, well your in luck. Italian, think Toscano or Benadetto. Burgers, go strait to BARTLEY'S. If not open, Tastey Burger or Shake Shack will hit the spot. Brunch, Henriettas table #1 and tres cher. If looking for affordable brunch, hit Park on lower JFK Street, excellent food a la cart. American Bistro, Harvest. French, Les Sablons. Both are fantastic. Want Hip with music most evenings, Beat Hotel. Finally, if you want over the top Mexican and it's cheap! Felipes is tour place. Drinks upstairs on the deck can be lots of fun during the warmer months, but arrive early or be prepared to wait for a while. Don't be scared off by the lines - they move quickly.

If your early and want breakfast, Darwins or Flour and on Mt. Auburn and Crema on the corner of Brattle are all popular with us locals. Do get a cup of hot chocolate in the winter - L.A.Burdicks - don't miss this opportunity on a cold day. Think thick delcious melting chocolate you can drink. Put it in the fridge and it becomes semi solid.

Plan to spend half a day and bring an appetite to this storied city across the river from Bean Town. "

He tooketh no selfies, so the statue of him is based on a favorite local pastime: good-natured speculation grounded in research. Behold what nearly four subsequent centuries hath wrought! Enjoy a walk, or sit, in the Yard, a four-season feast for architecture, landscape, and people-watching enthusiasts, and imagine the leaders, both celebrated and notorious, in politics (including eight U.S. presidents), law, humanities, arts, sciences, and business who have wandered through this Crimson space. Walk up the steps of Widener Library, a gift of a grieving mother in honor of her bibliophile son who perished on the Titanic. Visit Memorial Church, and especially the heartbreaking and astonishingly ornate World War I memorial, and be reminded that there are many from privileged backgrounds who do not dodge or scorn the ultimate sacrifice in the service of a larger good. Memorial Hall, with its rich, fantastic woodwork and stained glass windows, is a timely and hauntingly beautiful reminder of an American Civil War that often seems without end. Harvard extends far beyond the Yard area and has endless delights in store, from the Weeks Footbridge over the Charles River (try it at dawn or dusk for an unforgettable many-cupolaed sensory treat) to the Biz School, to the dazzling marbled magnificence of the Medical School Quad, to the green (in the environmental sense) and grand (in every sense) state-of-the-art Wasserstein Hall at the Law School.

4. The Art museum (I always forget the name) is good.

5. Toward the end of the day grab a drink at the bar of the Harvard Faculty Club. Just walk in like you own the place and say you are going to the bar and ask if they could point you in the right direction. Only do this if you are aged over 40 or are dressed nice. 

6. Walk across the river to the business school and look at the high temple of american corporate craziness. See if you can get into the cafeteria (called Spangler Hall, if I recall correctly). It's nuts.

Harvard is obviously a wonderful, world-famous school. If you can get in, then go. But Harvard is also a pompous, self-important, narrow-minded school that assumes everyone is uber-liberal. Harvard professors basically vote mindlessly liberal the way San Franciscans do. If that's your thing, then you'll feel 100% at home! If not, tough luck. We're Harvard. We know better. Look: It's a great school to go to, and it will be a great thing to have on your resume.
